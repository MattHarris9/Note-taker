# Note-taker

express Note taker

Description:
Using express, create and application to have the user create notes and save them off to the side.

Process:
since the front end was already done for us, I just had to create a server file to help run all the user requests.  I had to install express and use fs.  I had to creat app.get calls to get the data input to the index and notes html files, and make them in JSON strings.  Then a way ot save and posts these notes. I had slight trouble creating the delet functoin but eventually got it working.

Help:
I used postman to help with anytrouble shooting I had with the server side.
